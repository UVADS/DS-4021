    "# ðŸ§ªLab: Predicting Seismic Building Response with Support Vector Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will practice **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** in the context of **regression**. Over the past two weeks, we have focused on SVM for **classification problems**. However, SVM can also be extended to handle **regression tasks**â€”this is known as **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this, you will work with the following paper:  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81705-3\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, the authors use **real seismic monitoring data** to develop an SVR-based model for predicting the **maximum inter-story drift ratio** of buildings during earthquakes. The authors compare a full-feature model with a reduced-feature version, and demonstrate that SVR is effective in this complex, real-world regression setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will begin by reading the **introduction** of the paper to understand the motivation behind the problem. Later, you will apply Support Vector Regression to their dataset.\n",
    "\n",

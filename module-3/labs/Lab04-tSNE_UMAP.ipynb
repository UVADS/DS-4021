    "# ðŸ§ª LAB: Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction â€” t-SNE and UMAP\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few weeks, we have explored how to handle **non-linear relationships**, mainly in the context of **classification and regression** tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes the first and most important step is to **visualize** the data â€” to gain intuition, spot structure, or detect outliers â€” even before any predictive modeling. You have already seen how **PCA** can help with this, but as we discussed this week, PCA is a **linear method** and may not capture non-linear patterns in the data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn about two popular **non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques** that are particularly useful for **data visualization**:  \n",
    "- **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**  \n",
    "- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will apply and compare these methods on two datasets:\n",
    "- A simple biological dataset: **Palmer Penguins**\n",
    "- A high-dimensional human genotype dataset from the **1000 Genomes Project** (adapted from Diaz-Papkovich *et al.*, 2019)\n",

    "In this lab, you will explore **Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression**, a powerful technique for modeling relationships between high-dimensional, collinear predictors and a continuous outcome. You will begin with a **group discussion** after reading about the method. Next, you will become familiar with its implementation in `scikit-learn` by **recreating and reflecting on one of their tutorials**. Finally, you will apply PLS to a **real-world chemoinformatics dataset** that includes binary molecular fingerprints as predictors and a continuous permeability outcome for a set of chemical compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "PLS is particularly useful when the number of predictors is large and highly correlated, making traditional regression methods unstable or ineffective. You will also compare PLS with an alternative predictive model that also involves a dimensionality reduction approac **Penalized Principal Component Regression (PCR)**.\n",
